         <h2>My family</h2>
         <p>I have one brother and a bunch of cousins. I honestly don't know how many cousins I have. My dad works down at the port of Long Beach and my mom is retired from the police academy. My brother works at a hospital and just recently graduated from stanford and got his masters degree. My brother also enjoys his free time by messing around on his phone. My parents have a family reunion once a year because they both have big families.</p>

     <h2>My abilities</h2>
     <p>I know how to use Photoshop and SketchUp. Photoshop is computer graphics and SketchUp is like a 3D maker in a way. I also know how to code and type really well. I can also type at 60 WPM when we take typing tests.</p>
